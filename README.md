# Project on Medical Image Analysis
## Deep-Learning-Classification Malaria cells
The dataset of malaria cells used here is from NIH official website.
The original dataset contains 27,588 images.
This implementation is done using 100 images.
Keras is used to save the model on the disk and then loading it to classify the malaria cells either Parasitized or non Parasitized.
